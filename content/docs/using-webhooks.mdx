Webhooks are a powerful integration feature that allow you to propagate events from Fider to other applications.

Events happens when users interact on Fider. Four types of events currently exists, but more of them could be created in the future.

Webhooks are highly customizable and you can create as many webhooks as you need for each event type.

### Create a new Webhook

While logged in as an Administrator, navigate to **Site Settings -> Webhooks**.

This page list all created Webhooks, either Enabled or Disabled. To create a new one, click **Add New** and fill the form with all the required information as explained on the section below.

<h3 id="webhook-configuration">Webhook configuration</h3>

The power of this feature reside in its customization. Each Webhook has a name for you to quickly recognize it, a type defining its trigger event, a status
so you can enable or disable it, an URL and a content both formattable using Go templates, an HTTP method used to perform the request and even a set of
additional HTTP headers.

#### Name

The name is used in the admin control panel to identify the Webhook. You may give the name you want, it'll never get shown to users or sent in the request.
It do not needs to be unique: a unique ID display with a `#` symbol is always included with the name so you can distinguish two Webhooks with the same name.

#### Type

The type define which event will trigger this Webhook. It's also used to categorize them on the admin control panel. As new events could be added in future,
this attribute is subject to modification.

#### Status

The status define whether the Webhook is active or not. We highly recommend you to [test](#webhook-testing) your Webhook before
enabling it. When the execution of a Webhook fails, it'll automatically get disabled until you edit and fix it.

#### URL

The URL is one of the most important parts in the Webhook definition. Indeed, it is part of the definition of the HTTP request that this Webhook perform.
This is usually defined by your targeted application, and you must refer to its documentation to know how to get one.
See the list of [common Webhook targets](#common-webhook-targets-documentation) that you probably want to integrate with below to get some help with them.

#### Content

The content is the main element in your Webhook. You define here the data sent as HTTP request body. In most cases, the payload will include information
about the event that triggered it. Just like the URL, you can also use [Go template formatting](#writing-go-templates) here. Do not hesitate to check the integrated
help section by clicking on the information icon next to it. Take a look at the **Preview** zone to see what would your request contains with example data.

#### HTTP Method

This is the [HTTP request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) of the request triggered by the Webhook. In most cases, when sending
data in the **Content**, the HTTP method will be `POST`. Check your targeted application's documentation to be sure.

#### HTTP Headers

You can add any [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) you want here. Each header have a name and a value, and you cannot
define the same header twice. The most common headers are:

- `Content-Type`: use it to tell your application the MIME type of the data represented in your **Content**. Common values are: `application/json`, `text/plain`,
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `application/xml`...
- `Authorization`: use it to authenticate with given credentials.

#### The preview field

When writing templates, a preview is available before saving you check when it'll look like. Use it as many times as you need!

#### Presentation

[Go templates][go-template-doc] are a way to customize a text using external values (also called here "properties"). The engine used here is the
native `text/template` Go package. This is a powerful engine, but creating a basic templates is not complicated. You can write text as you want and insert a
property name, prefixed by a dot, enclosed in double braces with space within to place its value. For example, this is the most basic template with some values:

**Template**

```gotemplate
A new post entitled "{{ .post_title }}" has been created by {{ .author_name }}.
```

**Rendered text**

```
A new post entitled "Example dummy post title" has been created by Test.
```

In addition to properties, you can also use "functions", which are really useful to perform operations on values before they got inserted in the text. Example:
_(Read more about time formatting [here][go-time-format])_

**Template**

```gotemplate
The post was created on {{ format "Monday, 02 Jan 2006 at 15:04:05" .post_created_at }}.
```

**Rendered text**

```
The post was created on Friday, 07 May 2021 at 18:42:27.
```

To adapt the content dynamically depending on a property's value, you can even use "control structures", such as conditions and loops!
For example, you may add an element for post tags (also note the use of the minus sign `-` to trim lisibility white spaces):

**Template**

```gotemplate
The post have {{ if len .post_tags -}}
  {{ len .post_tags }} tag {{- if gt (len .post_tags) 1 -}} s {{- end }}:
  {{- range .post_tags }} {{ . }} {{- end -}}
{{- else -}}
  no tag
{{- end }}.
```

**Rendered text**

Post with tags

```
The post have 2 tags: tag1 tag2.
```

Post without tag

```
The post have no tag.
```

When using function call result as another function's argument, don't forget to parenthesis the expression: `{{ quote (format "15:04:05" .post_created_at) }}`.
You can also use a pipe character (`|`) to chain calls: `{{ .post_created_at | format "15:04:05" | quote }}` or `{{ format "15:04:05" .post_created_at | quote }}`.

Since the double braces are special characters in templates, if you need to insert them in your text, use the following trick: `{{ "{{" }}`. Do not hesitate
to consult the [official Go documentation][go-template-doc] about templates to see what are the possibilities.

#### Security disclaimer

You should always keep in mind user content may be insecure! Posts title and description, comments or users name are free text directly from the users.
You need to properly encode values like that when using them in JSON fields for example. The following example is a **bad** configuration:

```gotemplate
{
  "message": "{{ .post_description }}"
}
```

A malicious user could create a post with this description:

```gotemplate
Hacked!",
"important": true,
"from": "admin
```

When the template will be executed, the final result will look like:

```json
{
  "message": "Hacked!",
  "important": true,
  "from": "admin"
}
```

The targeted application may interpret the `"important": true` as a message requiring a notification and use the `from` field to set the sender. Thus, people
will receive a notification for a message from the admin saying "Hacked!". Pretty scary.

Please avoid these trouble and use the safety functions like `quote`, `escape`, `urlquery`, `stripHtml`...

The correct configuration would be (note the external quotes have been removed too):

```gotemplate
{
  "message": {{ quote .post_description }}
}
```

<h3 id="webhook-trigger-failure-report">Webhook trigger failure report</h3>

This report is shown when a manual trigger of a Webhook goes wrong. It means your configuration is incorrect and you should not enable this Webhook now.
A failed Webhook is automatically disabled until you edit it. It is a good practice to always test it after each edition to ensure nothing was broken.

<figure className="flex-1">
  <img src="/images/docs/webhooks/failure-report.png" />
  <figcaption>An extract of the failure report</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Understanding the report

There is a lot of informations included in the report and it may be disconcerting the first time you see it.

First, the **Message** indicates where the process was interrupted, and why. Then, the **Error** shows what went wrong and caused the trigger process to stop.
**URL** and **Content** are the parsed templates replaced with properties' values, helping you to understand the performed request.
The **Status code** is the [HTTP response status code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) returned by the request.
**Properties** are every variables you can use in templates associated with their resolved values.

<h3 id="webhook-testing">Testing</h3>

Before enabling any your Webhook on Fider, we highly recommend that you keep it disabled and use the **Trigger button** to confirm it's working properly.

**Trigger button** becomes available after creating a new Webhook. Whenever clicked, an event of the appropriate type is simulated,
triggered only this Webhook. A notification in the upper-right corner of the screen indicate the result of the trigger. Once you're happy with the configuration,
you can enable it and it will be triggered automatically with real properties every time the selected event occurs.

The result can be either a success: everything was good and the HTTP request was executed successfully; or a failure: something went wrong during the process.
In case of a success, check your targeted application to confirm everyhing is OK, then you can enable your Webhook.
However, if it was a failure, a report will be available beside your Webhook's name, by clicking on this information icon.
Read more about [Webhook trigger failure reports](#webhook-trigger-failure-report) here.

#### Analyzing the message and error

Four error **messages** are possible:

1. _Could not parse webhook URL template_
2. _Could not parse webhook content template_
3. _Could not execute webhook HTTP request_
4. _Webhook HTTP request returned an error response code_

For each of these messages, the **error** field will bring more precise information about:

1. What was malformated in the **URL** template
2. What was malformated in the **Content** template
3. What prevented the HTTP request from being executed
4. What did the server respond to the request

#### Solving problems

In case of **1.** or **2.**, you should verify your templates and do not hesitate to take advantage of the **Preview** area in the Webhook edition form.

Regarding the **3.**, it become more subtle. If anything, from the request sending, to the response reading, fails, it will be this error.
First of all, verify manually the URL to check if you didn't made a spelling mistake in your app's domain name.
Also, try pasting this URL in your browser to see if the targeted application is alive.
On your application, be sure to reply and properly close the HTTP connection after Webhook handling.
If you're trying to reach the Internet from an internal network, ensure your server can emit request to your application.

Finally, concerning the **4.**, the request was correctly sent to your application, but it was invalid. This can be caused by an invalid **URL**,
an inappropriate **content**, or even a missing **HTTP header**. Please refer to your application's official documentation and try to start with
basic example (sending `Hello World` seems to be a good idea to begin your debugging session).

A special case of failing could be the malformation of the result produced by templates with some values.
Here are some recommendations about this:

- Properties passed as GET parameters in the URL query (i.e. after the `?`) should always be encoded using `urlquery`.
  ```gotemplate
  https://example.org/webhook/fider?author={{ urlquery .author_name }}
  ```
- When using a structured text format such as JSON, or any other format asking you to enquote an element, you should use the `quote` function.
  ```gotemplate
  {
    "title": {{ quote .post_title }}
  }
  ```

When you think your problem has been solved, don't forget to [test](#webhook-testing) your Webhook before enabling it!
