We’ve got some exciting news to share with you all – Fider has new owners! Matt and Gary, two tech enthusiasts with a love for all things product and feedback-related, have officially taken the reins.

We know change can be a bit nerve-wracking, but don’t worry – Matt and Gary are committed to picking Fider up and moving it forward.

Here’s a quick word from Matt and Gary:

_“Hey everyone! We’re thrilled to be a part of the Fider community. We love what Fider does, a nice simple app, built on a great code base, and open source too - it’s a beautiful way for you to connect with your customers and innovate based on real feedback._

_It’ll take us a little bit of time to get full up and running, but the existing feedback you’ve all left us is a perfect starting point, expect to see us contributing and sharing opinions there soon!”_

So, here’s to new beginnings and a bright future for Fider. We’re grateful for your continued support and can’t wait to embark on this journey with you.

Cheers,
The Fider Team (now Matt and Gary!)
