          <h3>Scope</h3>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy covers Fider&apos;s treatment of personal data (&apos;Personal Data&apos;) that we gather when you access or otherwise use the
            Service. It explains what data we collect, why we collect the data, how it is used and your rights and choices.

          <p>
            While providing our Service, we may collect information about our customers&apos; users on behalf of our customers. Our use of this information is
            governed by our agreement with the applicable customer and the customer&apos;s own privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for
            the privacy policies or privacy practices of our customers or any other third parties.
          </p>
          <h3>Personal Identification Information</h3>
          <p>
            We may collect and use personal identification information that Users provide to us, including, but not limited to, when you register on the
            Service, submit a post, leave a comment, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Service.
            Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name and email address. You may refuse to supply this information; however, refusal may prevent you from
            engaging in certain activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            WE WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, SELL, RENT, LEASE, SHARE OR GIVE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR PURPOSES OF SPAMMING YOU, OR
            FOR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING, MARKETING OR PROMOTION.
          </p>
          <h3>How we use collected information</h3>
          <p>Fider may collect and use Users’ personal information for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>to provide, operate, and maintain our Service;</li>
            <li>to improve, personalize, and expand our Service;</li>
            <li>to understand and analyze how you use our Service;</li>
            <li>for billing purposes, if you have subscribed to one of our paid plans;</li>
            <li>
              for compliance purposes, including enforcing our Terms of Service, or other legal rights, or as may be required by applicable laws and regulations
              or requested by any judicial process or governmental agency.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            We are committed to protecting your information. To do so, we employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to protect information
            from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing
            your personal information. However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
          </p>
          <h3>Data Retention</h3>
          <p>
            We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a
            service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can, at any time, delete your account through the &apos;My Settings&apos; menu option. After deleting your account, all your personal
            information will be removed and the content you have published will be anonymized. You will no longer be able to access your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not
            possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
            and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <h3>Service Providers</h3>
          <p>
            We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (&apos;Service Providers&apos;), to provide the Service on our behalf,
            to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
          </p>
          <p>
            These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any
            other purpose.
