            website (the &apos;Service&apos;) operated by Fider (&apos;us&apos;, &apos;we&apos;, or &apos;our&apos;).
          </p>
          <p>
            Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users
            and others who access or use the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the
            Service.
          </p>
          <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
          <p>
            Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (&apos;Subscription(s)&apos;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
            periodic basis (&apos;Billing Cycle&apos;). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan
            you select when purchasing a Subscription.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it.
            You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team.
          </p>
          <p>
            A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide us with accurate and
            complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting
            such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment
            instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a
            certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.
          </p>
          <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
          <p>
            Fider, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become
            effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fider will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription
            before such change becomes effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription
            fee amount.
          </p>
          <h3>Refunds</h3>
          <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Fider on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Fider.</p>
          <h3>Accounts</h3>
          <p>
            When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so
            constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether
            your password is with our Service or a third-party service.

          <p>
            You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or
            unauthorized use of your account.
          </p>

            You further acknowledge and agree that Fider shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to

            you breach the Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the
            Service.
          </p>
          <h3>Limitation Of Liability</h3>

            content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty,
            contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if
            a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
